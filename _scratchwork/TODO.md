nice to have: generic graphs

integration steps depend on sinc lobe width vs grid size

Spawn workers for computations dynamically so they can be terminated if they run too long

Fix autocompute strategy. Make graphs wait before updating. Perhaps create that
plot store module for tracking plots added to the page. Have them listen to
a specific action on parameters before updating.
