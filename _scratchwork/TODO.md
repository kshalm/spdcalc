message about period poling and autocalc theta both enabled warning

message about autocalc theta enabled and modifying other parameters

nice to have: generic graphs

integration steps depend on sinc lobe width vs grid size

update comlink-loader to expose worker so it can be terminated

= optimization =

return heralding results as arrays

try using complex.finv() in singles calc

= Index of refraction data =

plot vs wavelengths
values for current wavelength

= autocalc waist position =

maybe we don't need optimization at all,
just set it to L/2 in free space and then divide by index of refraction for
whichever beam.

= freeze state =
lock certain plots in current state so parameter changes don't affect it
keep track of parameters used to compute current state
ability to label that module
unlocked => no refresh button
locked => has refresh button

= group modules =
modules can be loaded with several plots, larger card
around certain plots that are linked

= for waist stuff =
verify lambda/n >> 20 ??
